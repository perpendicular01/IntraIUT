# IntraIUT üéì

A unified event management platform for Islamic University of Technology (IUT) clubs and societies.

## üéØ Problem Statement

IUT has multiple clubs and societies that organize events frequently, but:
- Event announcements are scattered across various Facebook pages
- Information flow depends on Class Representatives (CRs) forwarding posts
- Many students miss events due to inconsistent communication

- Lists all IUT club and society events in one centralized location
- Reduces dependency on CRs and Facebook algorithms

- Allows clubs to schedule and promote events with better visibility
- Promotes higher participation and better time management
- Implements secure JWT authentication with role-based access control
